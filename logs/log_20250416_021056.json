This is a good time to share what I’ve learned and offer tips on applying these models with minimal stress.\nMy recent task involved analyzing unstructured text data (such as memos, emails, and free text comment fields) and classifying it according to categories relevant to business use cases. There are many methods available, and I’ve explored a variety, from simple pattern matching and lexicon searches to using pre-built neural network models for different functionalities, with moderately successful results.\nThe best approach seems to be combining multiple techniques in an ensemble to leverage their strengths.
