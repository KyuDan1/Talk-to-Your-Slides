        "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\nFor over 75 years, the federal government has provided grants and contracts to Harvard and other universities to support research. Combined with university investments, these efforts have led to key innovations in medicine, engineering, and science that have improved health and safety worldwide. Recently, the government has threatened partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, due to allegations of antisemitism on campuses. These partnerships are some of the most productive in U.S. history. New opportunities offer breakthroughs in treating diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, as well as advances in artificial intelligence, quantum science, and more. If the government ends these partnerships, it could harm the health of millions and jeopardize the nation’s economic strength."
