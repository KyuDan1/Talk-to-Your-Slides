        "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\nFor the past seventy-five years, the federal government has supported Harvard and other universities with grants and contracts, helping fuel groundbreaking innovations across medical, engineering, and scientific fields. These advances have vastly improved health and safety worldwide. Recently, the federal government has threatened to end its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, due to allegations of antisemitism on campuses.
