I've explored many approaches, from pattern matching and lexicon search to pre-built neural network models, with satisfactory results.\nThe best strategy seems to be using an ensemble of methods to leverage their strengths. I don’t fully trust these models alone to consistently deliver correct results, but combined with basic techniques, they enhance the accuracy."
