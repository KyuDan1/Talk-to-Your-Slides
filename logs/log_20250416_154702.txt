        "하버드 커뮤니티 여러분께,\n \n연방 정부는 75년 동안 하버드 및 다른 대학들에 연구비와 계약을 지원해 왔으며, 대학들의 자체 투자와 함께 광범위한 의학, 공학, 과학 분야에서 획기적인 혁신을 이루어 냈습니다. 이러한 혁신은 우리나라와 전 세계 수많은 사람들의 건강과 안전을 향상시켰습니다. 최근 몇 주간, 연방 정부는 캠퍼스 내 반유대주의 혐의로 하버드를 포함한 여러 대학과의 협력 관계를 위협하고 있습니다. 이 협력은 미국 역사상 가장 생산적이고 유익한 파트너십 중 하나입니다. 알츠하이머, 파킨슨병, 당뇨병과 같은 질환 치료부터 인공지능, 양자 과학 및 공학 그리고 여러 가능성 분야의 혁신적인 발전까지, 새로운 미래가 우리를 기다리고 있습니다. 정부가 지금 이 협력을 철회한다면 수백만 개인의 건강과 행복은 물론 국가의 경제적 안전과 활력도 위험에 처할 것입니다."
