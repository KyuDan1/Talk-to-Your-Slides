        "하버드 커뮤니티 여러분께,\n\n75년간 연방 정부는 하버드와 여러 대학에 보조금과 계약을 제공해 의학, 공학, 과학 분야에서 획기적인 혁신을 이끌었으며, 대학 자체 투자와 함께 이루어진 결과입니다. 이러한 혁신은 국내외 수많은 사람들의 건강과 안전을 향상시켰습니다. 최근 몇 주 동안 연방 정부는 우리 캠퍼스에서의 반유대주의 혐의를 이유로 하버드를 포함한 여러 대학과의 협력을 위협해 왔습니다. 이 파트너십들은 미국 역사상 가장 생산적이고 유익한 협력 중 하나였습니다. 우리는 알츠하이머, 파킨슨병, 당뇨병 등의 질병 치료부터 인공지능, 양자과학, 공학 분야의 발전에 이르기까지 다양한 혁신적 가능성이 기다리고 있습니다. 정부가 지금 협력을 철회한다면 수백만 명의 건강은 물론 국가의 경제 안정성과 활력도 위험에 처할 것입니다."
