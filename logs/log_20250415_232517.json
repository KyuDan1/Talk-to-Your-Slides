The task involved classifying unstructured text data (memos, emails, free text comments) into business-relevant categories.  Various techniques were explored, including pattern matching, lexicon search, and pre-built neural network models.  The best results were achieved by combining multiple techniques (ensembling) to leverage the strengths of each approach.  While individual models weren't consistently reliable, combining them with simpler methods improved accuracy."
