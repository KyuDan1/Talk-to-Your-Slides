Love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove:\nO no! it is an ever-fixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,\nWhose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle’s compass come:\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\nIf this be error and upon me proved,\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved."
